# 🚀 Upgrade PHP 7.4 to PHP 8 on RHEL 7.9

This guide will walk you through upgrading PHP from **7.4.33** to **PHP 8.0** on **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.9** using Remi and EPEL repositories.

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- ✅ Root or sudo access
- ✅ Internet access
- ✅ Current PHP version is 7.4.33
- ✅ Backup of system and data

---

## 📦 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 🔐 1. Backup Your System

Always start with a backup before making system-wide changes:

```bash
# Backup commands depend on your environment
# Example: snapshot VM, export DBs, tar important configs
```

---

### 📦 2. Enable EPEL and Remi Repositories

These repositories provide the latest PHP versions.

```bash
# Install EPEL repository
sudo yum install -y epel-release

# Install Remi repository
sudo yum install -y https://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-7.rpm
```

---

### 🔧 3. Install yum-utils

Install `yum-utils` to manage repositories and packages:

```bash
sudo yum install -y yum-utils
```

---

### 📂 4. Switch PHP Repository to PHP 8

First, disable the old PHP 7.4 repo and then enable the PHP 8 repo:

```bash
# Disable current PHP 7.4 repo
sudo yum-config-manager --disable remi-php74

# Enable PHP 8.0 repo
sudo yum-config-manager --enable remi-php80
```

---

### ⬆️ 5. Upgrade PHP

Now upgrade the PHP version:

```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

---

### ✅ 6. Confirm PHP Version

Verify that PHP 8.0 is installed:

```bash
php -v
```

Expected output:

```
PHP 8.0.x (cli) (built: ...)
```

---

### 🔌 7. Install Required PHP Extensions

Install any extensions required by your apps. For example:

```bash
sudo yum install -y php-mysqlnd php-gd php-mbstring php-xml php-cli
```

---

### ♻️ 8. Restart Web Server

Restart your web server to apply changes.

For **Apache**:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

For **Nginx + PHP-FPM**:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart php-fpm
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

---

### 🧪 9. Test Your Application

- Ensure all features of your application are working.
- Check logs for any deprecation or compatibility errors.
- Use `phpinfo();` or `php -m` to verify extensions.

---

## 📘 Notes

- PHP 8 introduces breaking changes. Review [Migration Guide](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration80.php).
- If you're using Composer or frameworks like Laravel or Symfony, make sure they're compatible.
- This guide uses PHP 8.0. For 8.1 or 8.2, replace `remi-php80` with `remi-php81` or `remi-php82`.
